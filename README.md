# PathVis
PathVis is a dual-mode web-based pathfinding visualizer featuring animated grid traversal and a Leaflet.js map-based view. It implements BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, A*, and Greedy Best-First Search with step-by-step visualizations from a unified landing interface.

# PathVis — Pathfinding Visualizer

PathVis is a web-based pathfinding visualization platform that demonstrates classic graph and shortest-path algorithms through two interactive modes:

* a grid-based animated visualizer, and
* a Leaflet.js-powered map-based visualizer for real-world routing scenarios.

Both modes are accessible from a unified landing page and provide step-by-step visualizations to improve understanding of algorithm behavior.

## Features

### Dual Visualization Modes

**Grid Mode**

* Pure grid-based animations
* Focused on algorithm traversal and logic clarity

**Map Mode (Leaflet.js)**

* Real-world map grid visualization
* Simulates realistic routing and heuristic-based pathfinding

### Algorithms Implemented

* Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Depth-First Search (DFS)
* Dijkstra’s Algorithm
* A* Search
* Greedy Best-First Search

### Interactive Controls

* Set and update start and end nodes dynamically
* Draw and remove walls/obstacles using mouse or trackpad input
* Visualize algorithm execution through step-by-step traversal animations
* Reset the grid or stop algorithm execution at any time
* Support for continuous wall drawing via mousepad drag interactions

## Why PathVis
